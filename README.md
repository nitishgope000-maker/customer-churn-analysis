Customer Churn Analysis – Python
Tools: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Dataset: Telco Customer Churn (7,043 records)

Project Overview
Conducted an end-to-end customer churn analysis for a telecom dataset to identify churn drivers, high-risk customer segments, and actionable retention strategies using Python-based data analysis and visualization.

Key Responsibilities & Work Performed
Data Preparation
Cleaned and preprocessed data using Pandas
Converted data types (e.g., TotalCharges to numeric)
Handled missing values and duplicates
Prepared a structured dataset for analysis

Feature Engineering
Created Contract Buckets (Short-, Mid-, and Long-Term)
Developed Tenure Bands to segment customers by lifecycle stage
Enhanced dataset to improve churn pattern analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Built 11 visualizations to analyze churn behavior
Analyzed churn across tenure, contract type, monthly charges, gender, and senior citizen status
Used boxplots and correlation heatmaps to identify key relationships

Key Insights
Contract type is the strongest churn driver: Month-to-month customers show the highest churn rate
Early-stage customers churn more: Highest churn observed within the first 3 months
Higher monthly charges increase churn risk
~32% of churned customers were on month-to-month contracts with 0–3 months tenure, indicating early onboarding issues

Business Recommendations
Improve onboarding experience for new customers
Introduce early-tenure engagement and discount programs
Promote upgrades from monthly to long-term contracts
Review pricing strategies for high-charge segments
Apply targeted retention campaigns using customer segmentation
